        "directions": "Braised Beef Brisket (Instant Pot and Stove Instructions):\nCombine brisket spices in a small bowl. Use a few teaspoons to rub on all sides of the brisket pieces. Add oil to the pot and brown the brisket on all sides using the saute function on the Instant Pot or over high heat on the stove if you're using a dutch oven/stock pot. Once it's nicely browned on all sides, remove and put on a plate.\nSaute onion and garlic until softened, scraping up brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the rest of the seasonings into the pot, followed by the remaining brisket ingredients. Submerge the meat into the liquid. Cook for 40 minutes on Pressure Cook or for about 2 hours on low heat in a pot on the stove. Once the meat can be easily shredded with a fork, it is ready. In some cases you may need to add 5-10 more minutes on the pressure cook function in an Instant Pot or another 30 minutes on the stove.\nRemove meat, shred and add back into the pot and cook on saute mode for 5-10 minutes so the excess water boils out of the braising liquid and the meat absorbs the flavor. If using a pot over the stove top, turn heat up to achieve a low boil and cook for 5-10 minutes.\nStreet Corn Salad:\n\nGrill up the corn and carefully slice it off the husk. Combine all street corn ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Refrigerate until youโre ready to use. You can make this a day ahead for maximum flavor and ease.\nJalapeรฑo Lime Ranch (Chuy's Creamy Jalapeรฑo Copycat Recipe):\nIn a food processor (or blender works too), puree cilantro leaves with the pickled jalapeรฑos and their juice. Puree until mostly smooth, scraping down the sides a few times. In a mixing bowl, add the mayo, ranch seasoning, garlic powder, and salt. Mix well to combine.\nPour cilantro mix directly into the sour cream mixture. Stir to combine. Add lime juice, then add in buttermilk a little at a time until you reach desired consistency. Store in a mason jar or a bowl tightly sealed. Refrigerate for up to five days. Best served chilled so they flavors have time to meld together.",

Make sure not to mix the syrup after the initial stir, otherwise the syrup could crystallize. The pot matters here, you want to make sure that your syrup will heat evenly!\nPrepare a cooling rack with parchment paper underneath the rack to catch any syrup drippings.\nOnce the syrup has reached a temperature of 225F/107C (this should take about 20 minutes using a gas stove), place the citrus slices in the syrup.\nContinue to heat the syrup and lemon slices until it reaches 245F/118C (this should take an additional 20 minutes using a gas stove), then turn off the heat. Remove the lemon slices one by one using a fork, food tweezers or a utensil that feels natural to you and place each slice on the prepared cooling rack.\nFor easy cleanup, add about a cup of water into your saucepan with the leftover syrup and continue to heat for a few minutes. The added water will help to dissolve any crusted sugar bits that are clinging to your pan.\nLet the lemons cool for 2 hours before enjoying or dipping them in melted chocolate!",

This can take up to 4 hours, or overnight, at room temperature. You can speed it up by placing pan in fridge with a sheet of foil over the top to prevent fridge smells.

Get a baking sheet out and place a wire rack/cooling rack on it. This is the trick to getting the chicken perfectly crispy and cooked.\nMix panko and seasoning together. Add it to a skillet and toast on medium/low heat, stirring often. Only toast until the panko darkens a bit in color, about 5 minutes. Take it off the heat and set aside.\nWorking with one chicken breast at a time, place inside a gallon zip-top bag and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Set the flattened chicken breast aside and repeat with remaining breasts.\nDrudge the chicken in the egg/mayo wash and then coat both sides with the panko crumb (I just coat the chicken in the skillet I used to taste the panko). Place the coated breasts on the wire rack thatโs on the baking sheet (see photo). Bake in the oven for 17-20 minutes or until internal temp is 165ยบ.\nOnce chicken is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes before slicing up. Slice up lettuce, tomato and get the mayo mixture and cheese ready.\nAssemble the wrap. Place everything into the center of the wrap, try now to overfill. Drizzle sauce of choice over the ingredients. Fold the wrap up like you would a burrito, both ends tucked in and then rolled horizontally.\nAdd the wrap to an oiled skillet pan on medium/high heat. Place the wrap with the folded side down first to seal it. Let it cook untouched for about 4 minutes each side. Once it is browned and crispy, remove from heat and let it cool for a minute. Then eat and enjoy. ",

The soup will thicken a bit more as it cooks, but the thickness/texture will be similar to what it is after you do this part, so keep that in mind. If you don't have a stick blender, transfer a ladle or two of beans to a regular blender, or use a potato masher or fork for a more rustic texture.\nReturn the sausage and bacon to the pot and add in the chopped carrots as well. Place the pot over high heat. Once the soup starts to boil, cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar and reduce the heat so it's simmering. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the carrots have softened and the soup has thickened up a bit more.\nStir in the spinach and let it wilt for a minute or two.

The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned.\nRemove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.\nMake the filling: Sift the remaining sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\nPour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\nOnce cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",

Mince a few onion wedges until you have 4 tablespoons.\nMelt 1 Tbsp butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add minced onion, half the garlic, half the pistachios (save the rest for serving), half the Shawarma Spice (you'll use the rest in the next step), and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in rice, 3/4 cup water, stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat. 4 SERVINGS: Use 2 Tbsp butter, a medium pot, and 1.5 cups water.\nMeanwhile, toss onion wedges, tomatoes, and chickpeas on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining Shawarma Spice, pepper, and a few pinches of salt. Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until veggies are tender and lightly charred and chickpeas are crispy, 18-20 minutes. 4 SERVINGS: Divide everything between 2 baking sheets; roast on top and middle racks, tossing veggies and swapping rack positions halfway through roasting. TIP: It's natural for chickpeas to pop a bit.\nWhile veggies and chickpeas roast, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and remaining garlic to taste. Season with salt. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.\nFluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 Tbsp butter and half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Once veggies and chickpeas are done, remove from oven and toss with lemon zest.\nDivide rice between shallow bowls. Top with veggies and chickpeas. Drizzle with garlicky white sauce and hot sauce to taste. Sprinkle with remaining pistachios and cilantro. Top with lemon juice to taste; serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.",
