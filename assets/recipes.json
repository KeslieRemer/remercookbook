The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned.\nRemove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.\nMake the filling: Sift the remaining sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\nPour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\nOnce cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",

In a small bowl, combine sour cream with half the chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.\nStir remaining chopped parsley into rice skillet. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Firmly flatten each ball with a spatula to create very thin patties. (TIP: Do so carefully; oil may splatter a bit.) Cook to desired doneness, 3-4 minutes per side. (Don't worry if the patties aren't perfectly round-those irregular edges will turn crispy.) In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with cheddar; cover pan until cheese melts.
